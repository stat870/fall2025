## Designed experiments  

The golden rules of designed experiments: 

- Replication 
- Randomization 
- Local control 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Principles for conducting valid and efficient experiments. From Box, Hunter and Hunter (2005).", out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}

### Treatment structure

- Solely about the treatment. 
- Most likely connected to the research question and thus defined by the subject matter expert.  

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic representation of a one-way treatment structure.", out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/trtdesigns_oneway.PNG")
```

A one-way treatment structure means that the expected value of the observations, $y$, is affected by one treatment factor with $k$ levels:   

$$g(\mu_{ij}) = \eta_{ij} = \eta_{0} + T_i,$$
where:

- $\mu_{ij}$ is the expected value of $y_{ij}$, the observation of the $i$th treatment and $j$th repetition, 
- $g(\cdot)$ is the link function, that ensures that the mean is within the support of the chosen distribution, 
- $\eta_{ij}$ is the linear predictor of $g(\mu_{ij})$, 
- $\eta_{0}$ is the overall mean, and 
- $T_i$ is the effect of the $i$th level of the treatment $T$. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic representation of a two-way factorial treatment structure.", out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/trtdesigns_twoway.PNG")
```

A two-way treatment structure is similar to a one-way treatment structure, only now the expected value is affected by two treatment factors:   

$$g(\mu_{ijk}) = \eta_{ijk} = \eta_{0} + T_i + G_j + (TG)_{ij} ,$$
where:

- $\mu_{ijk}$ is the expected value of $y_{ij}$, the observation of the $i$th treatment $T$, $j$th treatment $G$, and $k$ repetition, 
- $g(\cdot)$ is the link function, that ensures that the mean is within the support of the chosen distribution, 
- $\eta_{ijk}$ is the linear predictor of $g(\mu_{ijk})$, 
- $\eta_{0}$ is the overall mean,  
- $T_i$ is the effect of the $i$th level of the treatment $T$, 
- $G_j$ is the effect of the $j$th level of the treatment $G$, and 
- $(TG)_{ij}$ is the interaction between the $i$th level of treatment $T$, and $j$th level of treatment $G$. 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic representation of a tree-way factorial treatment structure.", out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/trtdesigns_threeway.PNG")
```

### Design structure  

The experiment design describes the data generating process ("blueprint" of the data). 

- You'll notice that the models above only consider the treatment sources of variability to explain variations in the observed values. 
- How were the treatments above (logistically) applied? 

**Useful questions:** 

- What is the experimental unit?  
- What is the blueprint of the design? (which observations are similar to what)
