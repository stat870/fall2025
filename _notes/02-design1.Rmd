## Announcements

## Designed experiments  

Designed experiments are data-generating processes under **controlled** settings. 

The golden rules of designed experiments: 

- Replication 
- Randomization 
- Local control 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Principles for conducting valid and efficient experiments. From Box, Hunter and Hunter (2005).", out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/principles.jpg")
```


### Treatment structure

- Solely about the treatment. 
- Most likely connected to the research question.  

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic representation of a one-way treatment structure.", out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/trtdesigns_oneway.PNG")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic representation of a two-way factorial treatment structure.", out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/trtdesigns_twoway.PNG")
```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic representation of a tree-way factorial treatment structure.", out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/trtdesigns_threeway.PNG")
```

### Design structure  

- How were the treatments above (logistically) applied? 

Useful questions: 

- What is the experimental unit?  
- What is the blueprint of the design? (which observations are similar to what) 

## Applied example: fungicide effects on barley genotypes   

The data below were generated by an experiment that aimed to study the effect of fungicide and barley genotypes on grain yield.  

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(agridat)
library(lme4)
library(emmeans)
```

```{r}
df_fungicide <- agridat::durban.splitplot

df_fungicide %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bed, row))+
  # geom_tile(aes(fill = block))+
  geom_tile(aes(fill = fung))+
  # geom_tile(aes(fill = gen))+
  geom_tile(aes(), color = "black", fill = NA)
  
```

- What is the treatment structure? 
- What are the experimental units? 
- How many independent observations per treatment factor? 
- What is the design structure?
