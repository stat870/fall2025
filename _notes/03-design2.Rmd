## Designed experiments  

Let's review the basics of designed experiments:  

- Research question 
- Planning the experiment  
- Treatment structure - directly dependent on the research question 
- Design structure - mostly depending on logistics. May depend on the research question. 

### Design structures  

While the treatment structure defines what effects we will try and estimate as precisely as possible, the design structure tells us the story of **how** those treatments were applied. 
Some of the most common designed experiments include 

- completely randomized design (CRD), 
- randomized complete block design (RCBD), 
- split-plot design, 
- relevant variations to the designs above:  
  - generalized randomized complete block design, 
  - strip-plot design, 
  - repeated measures designs. 


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic description of an experiment with a completely randomized design", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/designs_crd.PNG")
```


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic description of an experiment with a randomized complete block design", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/designs_rcbd.PNG")
```


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Schematic description of a field experiment with a split-plot design", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/designs_splitplot.PNG")
```


## Applied example: fungicide effects on barley genotypes   

Let's consider an experiment that aimed to study the effect of fungicide and barley genotypes on grain yield. The study includes two levels of fungicide, and 70 different genotypes, considering all their possible combinations. 

- What is the treatment structure of the experiment?
- Do we know the design structure of the experiment?

**Now, the actual experiment was run like this:** 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(agridat)
library(lme4)
library(emmeans)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
df_fungicide <- agridat::durban.splitplot

df_fungicide %>% 
  ggplot(aes(bed, row))+
  # geom_tile(aes(fill = block))+
  geom_tile(aes(fill = fung))+
  # geom_tile(aes(fill = gen))+
  geom_tile(aes(), color = "black", fill = NA)
```

- What is the treatment structure? 
- What are the experimental units? 
- How many independent observations per treatment factor? 
- What is the design structure?
