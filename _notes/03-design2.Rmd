## Designed experiments  

Let's review the basics of designed experiments:  

- Research question 
- Planning the experiment  
- Treatment structure 
- Design structure 

### Desgin structures  

While the treatment structure defines what effects we will try and estimate as precisely as possible, the design structure tells us the story of **how** those treatments were applied. 
The main objective of 
Some of the most common designed experiments include 

- completely randomized design (CRD), 
- randomized complete block design (RCBD), 
- split-plot design, 
- variations like 
  - generalized randomized complete block design, 
  - strip-plot design, 
  - repeated measures designs.
