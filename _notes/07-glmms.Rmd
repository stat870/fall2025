## Review about the (general) linear mixed model

One of the most common notations is the model equation form:

$$y_{ij} = \mu + T_i + \varepsilon_{ij} , \\ \varepsilon_{ij}\sim N(0, \sigma^2),$$
which is very much restrictive. 

## Generalized linear mixed models

Now, if we relax the assumption of the normal distributions, there are several other probability distributions that could describe how the data are generated. 
GLMMs are linear models for variables from any distribution from the exponential family.

### Three steps to modeling data 

1. Define the linear predictor $\boldsymbol\eta = \mathbf{X}\boldsymbol{\beta} + \mathbf{Z}\mathbf{u}$, 
2. Define the probability distribution for the data, $\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{u}$, 
3. Define the link function $g(\cdot)$, $\boldsymbol\eta = g(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{u})$. 

### Implications for classical (non-Bayesian) analysis 

- Least Squares Estimator is no longer Maximum Likelihood Estimator - The $Var(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{u})$ may be specified, but not specify the full likelihood (check out the properties above) 
- Quasi-likelihood for modeling overdispersion in GLMMs: 
  - $E(\mathbf{y} \vert \mathbf{b}) = \boldsymbol{\mu}\vert \mathbf{b}$ 
  - $Var(\mathbf{y} \vert \mathbf{b}) = \mathbf{V}_{\mu}^{1/2}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V}_{\mu}^{1/2}$
