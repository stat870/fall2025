# Semester Project

Semester projects may deal with any topic that interests you [the student], as long as it is approved by the instructor.  

Broadly, projects are expected to **identify a research problem** and **develop an appropriate workflow that is appropriate for solving that problem**. Projects consist of a manuscript and a reproducible tutorial that describes the research problem, the experiment design and the treatment design.  

## Learning objectives   

- Be able to identify an experiment design that is appropriate for answering a given research question and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of that design for answering the question.  
- Be able to write the materials and methods section of a paper/thesis, including the statistical model that corresponds the experiment design.

## Partial deadlines

### Project proposal - Due Friday September 24 at 11:59pm CT
Write a page-long project proposal that states your research problem and the objective of your project. An example of an appropriate project proposal can be found [here](https://stat870.github.io/fall2025/assignments/proposal_example.pdf).

### Written report for peer review - Due Thursday November 27 at 11:59pm CT for peer review 

### Oral presentation - Somewhere between December 3 - December 12
Prepare a 15 minute presentation of the core aspects of your project. 
Presentations should include at least: 

- Motivation  
- Methods, including a clear and complete description of the statistical model and code
- Discussion of strengths and weaknesses

### Written report - Due Friday December 19 at 11:59pm CT for peer review 
Submit a manuscript including:

- Introduction (background \& justification of the problem) 
- Methods, including: 
  - A complete ANOVA table describing the degrees of freedom associated to mean comparisons, 
  - A clear and complete description of the statistical model,
  - R code that would be implemented to fit that model,
- Expected results 
- Discussion of strengths and weaknesses of the experiment design (e.g., compare an RCBD with a split-plot design)
