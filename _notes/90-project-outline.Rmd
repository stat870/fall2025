# Semester Project

Semester projects may deal with any topic that interests you [the student], as long as it is approved by the instructor.  

Broadly, projects are expected to (i) identify a research problem, (ii) develop an appropriate workflow that is appropriate for solving that problem, and (iii) create a report and reproducible tutorial. 

## Learning objectives   

- Be able to identify an experiment design that is appropriate for answering a given research question and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of that design for answering the question.  
- Be able to write the materials and methods section of a paper/thesis, including the statistical model that corresponds the experiment design.

## Partial deadlines
