# Semester Project

Semester projects may deal with any topic that interests you [the student], as long as it is approved by the instructor.  

Broadly, projects are expected to (i) identify a research problem, (ii) develop an appropriate workflow that is appropriate for solving that problem, and (iii) create a report and reproducible tutorial. 

## Learning objectives   

- Be able to identify an experiment design that is appropriate for answering a given research question and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of that design for answering the question.  
- Be able to write the materials and methods section of a paper/thesis, including the statistical model that corresponds the experiment design.

## Partial deadlines

### Project proposal - Due Friday September 24 at 11:59pm CT 
Write a page-long project proposal that states your research problem and the objective of your project. An example of an appropriate project proposal can be found [here](https://stat870.github.io/fall2025/assignments/proposal_example.pdf).

### Written report for peer review - Due Thursday November 27 at 11:59pm CT for peer review 

### Oral presentation - Somewhere between December 3 - December 12

- Discussion of strengths and weaknesses. 

### Written report - Due Friday December 19 at 11:59pm CT for peer review
