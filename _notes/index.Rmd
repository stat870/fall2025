- In rounds: What's your major, what do you expect to learn?

## Learning goals   

By the end of this course, you should be able to:  
- Be able to identify the treatment design, experiment design, experimental unit and observational unit.  
- Be able to write the statistical model that corresponds to (simple) designed experiments.  
- Be able to write the Materials and Methods section in a paper (or thesis) that describes the designed experiment.  
- Distinguish the benefits/disadvantages of different experiment designs.  


## On notation  

- scalars: $y$, $\sigma$, $\beta_0$  
- vectors: $\mathbf{y} \equiv [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]'$, $\boldsymbol{\beta} \equiv [\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_p]'$, $\boldsymbol{u}$  
- matrices: $\mathbf{X}$, $\Sigma$  
- probability distribution: $y \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, $\mathbf{y} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \sigma^2\mathbf{I})$.     


## For tomorrow    

- Install R and RStudio.
