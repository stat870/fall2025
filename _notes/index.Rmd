# Welcome to STAT 870!  
August 25th, 2025  

## About this course:  

- [About me](https://jlacasa.github.io/) 
- About you: 

```{r message=F, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
read.csv("../../students_STAT_870_A.csv") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = degreeProgram))+
  geom_bar(fill = "#B388EB")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.border = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, vjust = 1, hjust=1))
```

- In rounds: What's your major and what do you expect to learn in 870?  

## What is messy data anyways?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="What is messy data", out.width = '100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../figures/messydata.jpg")
```

## Learning goals   

By the end of this course, you should be able to:  
- Identify the treatment design, experiment design, experimental unit and observational unit of simple and complex designed experiments.  
- Distinguish the benefits/disadvantages of different experiment designs.  
- Write the statistical model that corresponds to designed experiments.  
- Write the Materials and Methods section in a paper (or thesis) that describes the designed experiment.  

## On notation  

- scalars: $y$, $\sigma$, $\beta_0$  
- vectors: $\mathbf{y} \equiv [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]'$, $\boldsymbol{\beta} \equiv [\beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_p]'$, $\boldsymbol{u}$  
- matrices: $\mathbf{X}$, $\Sigma$  
- probability distribution: $y \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$, $\mathbf{y} \sim N(\boldsymbol{0}, \sigma^2\mathbf{I})$.     


## Homework & Announcements  

- Install R and RStudio. 
- Submit [Assignment 1](https://stat870.github.io/fall2025/assignments/Assignment1_YourLastName.pdf) by next Monday. 
- Applied Linear Mixed Models Workshop
