Assignments may be completed individually or in groups of two people. Group studying is encouraged in this class, but individual files must be submitted by each person.  

**Grading criteria** 

Things that may subtract points from your assignments: 

- Not silencing unnecessary warnings/messages (e.g., when loading a package) 
- Hard-to-read math notation (see example below) 
- Unnecessarily long answers that include unrequested blabber
