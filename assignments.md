Assignments may be completed individually or in groups of two people. Group studying is encouraged in this class, but individual files must be submitted by each person.  

To get full points, make sure you: 

- Silence unnecessary warnings/messages (e.g., when loading a package).  
- Use clean math notation using $$\\LaTeX$$ or pasting an image of a statistical model using pen and paper.
