## Goal of this assignment  

The goals of this assignment are to: 

- Review treatment structure and design structure of designed experiments.  
- Analyze data generated by a designed experiment using statistical software. 

Please complete exercises (1) and (2), rename the `Rmd` file to "Assignment2_YourLastName.Rmd" (e.g., "Assignment2_Smith.Rmd"), your name in the header, and knit the Rmd to an html file or pdf file. Please submit that html or pdf file on CANVAS by Wednesday, September 10th by midnight. You may work in pairs, but each one of you will have to submit your own file. 

**Formatting**: Please make sure that your knitted pdf or html document does not include unnecessary warnings/messages.  
For the statistical models, you can use \LaTeX code embedded in your Rmd, or paste a picture. You can check the raw Rmd files from the lectures (including \LaTeX code) at [https://github.com/stat870/fall2025/tree/main/_notes](https://github.com/stat870/fall2025/tree/main/_notes). Otherwise, you can check out the [Rmd cheatsheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/html/rmarkdown.html) or the `knitr::include_graphics()` function. 

## 1. 

Below are two snippets from peer-reviewed papers. For all, identify the treatment structure, the design structure, or mention if this information is unclear or unavailable. 

### 1a. 

From "Plasma concentrations of substance P and cortisol in beef calves after castration or simulated castration" - coetzee et al. (2008) [[link](https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/ajvr/69/6/ajvr.69.6.751.xml)] 

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="From Coetzee et al. (2008)", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/coetzee_2008.png")
```

### 1b. 

From "Maize Kernel Weight Response to Postflowering Sourceâ€“Sink Ratio" - Borras and Otegui (2001) [[link](https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2135/cropsci2001.1816)]

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="From Borras and Otegui (2001)", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("img/borras2001.jpg")
```

## 2. 

The data in the code below correspond to a trial studying the effects of agronomic management, and the timing of said agronomic management on plant height for rice. 
The scientists were able to divide the field into equally-sized blocks that are able to fit all treatments. 
Then, the scientists randomly allocated the management treatments to smaller areas within the blocks. 
After that, they assigned the timings to even smaller areas of the management treatments. 
From each block-management-timing treatment combination, they were able to measure plant height twice. 

### 2a. 

What is the treatment structure and the design structure in this experiment? 
Write the statistical model that best represents the data generating process. 
Then, fit that model to the data, check model assumptions, report all variance components, and the estimated marginal means (including some measure of uncertainty) for all time-management combinations. 

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(agridat)
library(mgcv)
data("gomez.splitplot.subsample")
df <- gomez.splitplot.subsample

model1 <- lmer(height ~ time*manage +(1|rep/manage/time),
               data = df)

simulateResiduals(model1, plot = T)
car::Anova(model1)
```
