# Assignment 1  
  
The goal of this assignment is to (i) review a few basic concepts and to (ii) make sure that you can knit an `Rmd` document with the basic features that will be needed throughout this course. 
Please complete exercises (1) and (2), download the `Rmd` file [here](https://stat720.github.io/summer2025/assignments/Assignment1_YourLastName.Rmd), 
rename the `Rmd` file to "Assignment1_YourLastName.Rmd" (e.g., "Assignment1_Smith.Rmd"), put your name in the header, and knit the Rmd to an html file or pdf file. 
Please submit that html or pdf file on CANVAS by Friday, June 20th midnight. 
You may work in pairs, but each one of you will have to submit your own file.
