The goals of this assignment are to: 
  
- Review treatment structure and design structure of designed experiments, including repeated measures.  
- Review model selection.  
- Review fundamental topics from (generalized) linear mixed models. 

Please write an e-mail to the pretend-researcher that contacted you in our in-class exercise on October Wednesday 24th.  
Answer the researcher's questions and mention one way they could improve the power of their experiment to detect differences in final weight between treatments. 
Researcher's questions were: 

*I need help with the following:*  
- *Describing the experiment design for materials and methods.* 
- *Analyzing the data and determining:* 
  - *If there are differences between vaccines, especially at harvest,* 
  - *If there is a "better vaccine" for final weight,* 
  - *If there is difference in jaw deformity between vaccine treatments.*
