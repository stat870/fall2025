Grades: A (100-89.999999999(!!!)), B (89.99-79.99), C (79.99-69.99), D (69.99-59.99), F (&lt;59.99). Attendance policies Semester projects 1.2 Learning goals By the end of this course, you should be able to: - Be able to identify the treatment design, experiment design, experimental unit and observational unit. - Be able to write the statistical model that corresponds to (simple) designed experiments. - Be able to write the Materials and Methods section in a paper (or thesis) that describes the designed experiment. - Distinguish the benefits/disadvantages of different experiment designs. 1.3 On notation scalars: \\(y\\), \\(\\sigma\\), \\(\\beta_0\\) vectors: \\(\\mathbf{y} \\equiv [y_1, y_2, ..., y_n]&#39;\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{\\beta} \\equiv [\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_p]&#39;\\), \\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\) matrices: \\(\\mathbf{X}\\), \\(\\Sigma\\) probability distribution: \\(y \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\), \\(\\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\boldsymbol{0}, \\sigma^2\\mathbf{I})\\). 1.4 For tomorrow Install R and RStudio.

Broadly, projects are expected to identify a research problem and develop a designed experiment that is appropriate for solving that problem. Projects consist of a manuscript and a tutorial that describes the research problem, the experiment design and the treatment design. 3.1 Learning objectives Be able to identify an experiment design that is appropriate for answering a given research question and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of that design for answering the question. Be able to write the materials and methods section of a paper/thesis, including the statistical model that corresponds the experiment design. 3.2 Partial deadlines 3.2.1 Project proposal - Due Friday June 20 at 2pm CT Write a page-long project proposal that states your research problem and the objective of your project. An example of an appropriate project proposal can be found here. 3.2.2 Written report - Due Wednesday July 23 at 2pm CT for peer review Submit a manuscript including: Introduction (background &amp; justification of the problem) Methods, including: A complete ANOVA table describing the degrees of freedom associated to mean comparisons, A clear and complete description of the statistical model, R code that would be implemented to fit that model, Expected results Discussion of strengths and weaknesses of the experiment design (e.g., compare an RCBD with a split-plot design) 3.2.3 Oral presentation - Somewhere between July 21 - August 1 Prepare a 15 minute presentation of the core aspects of your project. Presentations should include at least: Motivation Methods, including a clear and complete description of the statistical model and code Discussion of strengths and weaknesses 3.2.4 Practical reads Casler, M.D. (2015), Fundamentals of Experimental Design: Guidelines for Designing Successful Experiments.
